Facebook Graph API (Simple Guide)
The Graph API is the way apps "talk" to Facebook. It allows you to read and write data—like posts, photos, and profile info—using simple web links.
💡 How it WorksThink of Facebook as a giant map of connections. The API uses three things to navigate it:Nodes: The "Things" (A User, a Page, a Photo).Edges: The "Connections" (A User's photos, a Page's posts).Fields: The "Details" (A name, a birthday, an image URL).
🚀 3 Steps to StartGet a Token: Sign up at developers.facebook.com and create an "App" to get an Access Token (your digital key).Pick a Node: Use the ID of the person or page you want to look at. Use /me to look at yourself.Send a Request: Put the URL into your browser or code.Example Request:https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=name,email&access_token=YOUR_TOKEN🛠 What can you do?ActionWhat it doesReadGet a list of your posts or your friends (who also use the app).PostPublish a status update or a photo to a Page.AnalyzeCheck how many people liked or commented on a post.DeleteRemove a post that your app created.
⚠️ Things to RememberPermissions: You can't see everything. You must ask the user for permission (like user_photos) before you can access their data.Tokens Expire: Most "keys" only last for a few hours or days before you need a new one.Versions: Facebook updates the API often. Always use the latest version (e.g., v21.0) in your links.
